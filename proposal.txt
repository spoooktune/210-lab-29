Project Overview:
For my project, I want to simulate a game store that sells 
multiple varieties of products. The software will keep track of the
items sold over the course of 50 days and show the impact of major
events on how each item sells.

Implementation:
An std::map will hold different items, with the key being the name 
of the item. The held values will be an array of data on the number of
items sold per day, the day's current price, and the item's rating. Each day,
a certain amount of items are sold, which is calculated based on the item's rating
and price.

Simulated Events:
The simulation will include 4 categories of events that will cause a change in how
many products are sold. This will include a new release of an item, a sale, 
a price hike, and poor reviews of an item. Each of these events will have a 
specific chance of occuring each day. Only one event will occur to an item each day.

new release - 10%
sale on an item - 7%
price hike - 7%
poor reviews - 10%
