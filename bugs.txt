Bugs from alpha and beta
alpha
- inserting a new pair into the store map in new_item function 
  resulted in an error, fixed by wrapping the array using std::array, did 
  not effect any of the other code in the function
- new_price variable in sale and price_hike functions displayed values 
  higher/lower than expected, caused because p_change variable was in 
  percentage form and not decimal, fixed by dividing p_change by 100.0
- new_item function could add an item with the same name and overwrite the
  previous data for the item, fixed by adding code to check if name variable
  is the same as any key values in store map. if there is any match, the code
  to get a random name reruns until a new item name is picked. 
- code for displaying final summary was formatted incorrectly, final item data
  was printed incorrectly, fixed by changing the way all data was outputted

beta
- chance for events to randomly occur was too low, very little events occuring and 
  therefore inaccurate, changed value of const int variables to be more accurate
  NEW_ITEM: 10 -> 30
  SALE: 7 -> 30
  PRICE_HIKE: 7 -> 15
  RATING_DEC: 10 -> 7
- after sale, price_hike, or rating_decrease event occurs, the copies sold outputted in 
  the daily summary does not change until the next day, when it should change the same day.
