Bugs from alpha and beta
alpha
- inserting a new pair into the store map resulted in an error (line 73), 
  fixed by wrapping the array using std::array, did not effect any of the 
  other code in the function
- new_price variable in sale and price_hike functions displayed values 
  higher/lower than expected (lines 84 and 101), caused because p_change
  variable was in percentage form and not decimal, fixed by dividing p_change
  by 100.0
- new_item function could add an item with the same name and overwrite the
  previous data for the item, fixed by adding code to check if name variable
  is the same as any key values in store map. if there is any match, the code
  to get a random name reruns until a new item name is picked.
