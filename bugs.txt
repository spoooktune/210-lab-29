Bugs from alpha and beta
alpha
- inserting a new pair into the store map in new_item function 
  resulted in an error, fixed by wrapping the array using std::array, did 
  not effect any of the other code in the function
- new_price variable in sale and price_hike functions displayed values 
  higher/lower than expected, caused because p_change variable was in 
  percentage form and not decimal, fixed by dividing p_change by 100.0
- new_item function could add an item with the same name and overwrite the
  previous data for the item, fixed by adding code to check if name variable
  is the same as any key values in store map. if there is any match, the code
  to get a random name reruns until a new item name is picked. 
- code for displaying final summary was formatted incorrectly, final item data
  was printed incorrectly, fixed by changing the way all data was outputted

beta
- chance for events to randomly occur was too low, very little events occuring and 
  therefore inaccurate, changed value of const int variables to be more accurate
  NEW_ITEM: 10 -> 30
  SALE: 7 -> 30
  PRICE_HIKE: 7 -> 15
  RATING_DEC: 10 -> 7
- daily summary for day 1 of simulation was not printed, fixed by calling print_summary
  function after 5 initial items were added
- number of items added initially were too low, fixed by changing the amount of times 
  the day 1 for loop occured from 5 to 10 times. 
- after sale, price_hike, or rating_decrease event occurs, the copies sold outputted in 
  the daily summary does not change until the next day, when it should change the same day.
  caused because of break statements that ran after an event occured. fixed by altering if 
  statments that handled if an event occured - checks if event == false and if event can occur
  before running the code
- in the calc_daily_sold function, copies_sold sometimes goes below 0, which is not possible in
  an actual store. fixed by setting copies_sold to 0 if it is negative after initial calculation
- in print_summary function and for the final summary, price is not always displayed with 2 decimal 
  points, fixed by adding fixed << setprecision(2) when displaying price, setprecision(1) when
  displaying ratings, and setprecision(0) when displaying copies sold
- in final summary, some item names clashed with the data when displayed. fixed by increasing SW_TITLE
  from 40 to 47
